# NovetusMasterServerList
Put this into your "htdocs" or "www" or wherever your "serverlist.txt" is located to view all servers running on master server <3<br><br>

This is currently PoC (Proof Of Concept), I do not recommend using it on prod until I make the full one which should be out in a couple of weeks<br><br>

Credit me while using my stuff :heart:
